Certainly! Below is a README template that outlines the steps we went through to set up your JADE project in a Maven environment and how to run two communicating agents. You can adjust the details as necessary to better fit your specific project setup.

# JADE Agents Project: Basketball Players

This project demonstrates the setup and running of two communicating JADE agents within a Maven-enabled Java development environment using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as the primary IDE.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following software is installed on your system before proceeding:

- **Java JDK**: Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher.
- **Maven**: Apache Maven for managing project dependencies and builds.
- **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**: With the Java Extension Pack installed.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Java and Maven

- **Java**: Download and install the JDK from [Oracle's JDK Download](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.
- **Maven**: Download and install Maven from [Apache Maven Project](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

### 2. Configure Maven and VSCode

- Install the **Java Extension Pack** in VSCode via the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
- Ensure Maven is configured correctly by checking its path in your system's environment variables.

### 3. Download and Set Up JADE

- Download JADE from the [JADE Official Website](http://jade.tilab.com/download/jade/).
- Include the JADE library in your project's Maven dependencies by adding the custom repository and dependency in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jade-repo</id>
        <url>https://jade.tilab.com/maven/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.tilab.jade</groupId>
        <artifactId>jade</artifactId>
        <version>4.5.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### 6. Running the Project

- Compile and run your project using Maven:
  ```
  mvn clean compile exec:java
  ```
- This command should launch the JADE GUI and start your agents within the JADE environment.
